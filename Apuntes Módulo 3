Module 3
--------
Conditions
	#Condition Statements
	#equal: ==
	#not equal: !=
	#greater than: >
	#less than: <
	#greater than or equal to: >=
	#less than or equal to: <=
	
	# Condition Equal
		a = 5
		a == 6 #Here the value a is set to equal 6, above the program asks if a is equal to another value, not setting it. 
	# Greater than Sign
		i = 6
		i > 5 #True
	# Greater than Sign
		i = 2
		i > 5 #False
	# Inequality Sign
		i = 2
		i != 6 #when we test for the inequality, only when i equals 6 (the inequality)we will receive a false return
	# Comparing Strings
		'pepe' == 'pepi' #false they aren't equal
		'pepe' != 'pepi' #true they aren't equal
	# Compare characters
		'B' > 'A'
		'BA' > 'AB' #with multiple characters the first letter takes precedence in ordering
------------------------------------------
If's
	# If statement example

		age = 19
	#age = 18

	#expression that can be true or false
		if age > 18:
    
    	#within an indent, we have the expression that is run if the condition is true
    			print("you can enter" )
	#You can also use else statements to add other output possibilities
		else:
    			print("Go see Tatiana" )
	#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false
		print("move on")

	#The elif statement allows us to check additional conditions if the condition statements prior to it are false. 
	# Elif statment example
		age = 18
		if age > 18:
    			print("you can enter" )
		elif age == 18:
    			print("go see Cartel de Santa")
		else:
    			print("go see Tatiana")
		print("move on")

	# Condition statement example
		dog_year = 1983
	#dog_year = 1970
		if dog_year > 1980:
    			print("dog year is greater than 1980")
		else:
    			print("less than 1980")
		print('nice dog')

	# Condition statement example AND
		dog_year = 1980
		if(dog_year > 1979) and (dog_year < 1990):
    			print ("Dog year was in between 1980 and 1989")
		print("That's an old dog")
		
	# Condition statement example OR
		dog_year = 1990
		if(dog_year < 1980) or (dog_year > 1989):
    			print ("Dog was not born in the 1980's")
		else:
    			print("The Dog was born in the 1980's ")

	# Condition statement example NOT
		dog_year = 1983
		if not (dog_year == 1984):
    			print ("Dog year is not 1984")
---------------------------------------------------------
Loops
	# First think of ranges, where range(3) would generate an object containing elements ordered from 0 to 2
		range(3)
	# For loop example, the code is executed N times each time the value of i is increased for every execution, stopping when the range dates ends.
		dates = [1982,1980,1973]		
		N = len(dates)
		for i in range(N):
    			print(dates[i]) 
	# For loop to print a sequence from o to 7
		for i in range(0, 8):
    			print(i)
	# Exmaple of for loop, loop through list
		for year in dates:  
    			print(year)   
			dates = [1982,1980,1973]
	# Use for loop to change the elements in list
		squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']
		for i in range(0, 5):
    			print("Before square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])
    			squares[i] = 'white'
   			print("After square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])

	# The while loop will repeat itself only after a condition is found to not be True/False...
	# While Loop Example
		dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]
		i = 0
		year = dates[0]
		while(year != 1973):    
    			print(year)
    			i = i + 1
    			year = dates[i]
		print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.")
